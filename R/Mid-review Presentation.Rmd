# Introduction

* Why money is left unclaimed:
    + Forgetting
    + Bad bookkeeper
    + Moving

* Our research:
    + Monetary value
    + Number of accounts 

* Reasons for choosing this topic:
    + No one has analysed this data before.
    + Original idea
    + Challenge
    + No copyright

# Approach
* 380,671 accounts, going back to the year 1900. 
* Tableau
* R
    + Merging
    + Cleaning
    + Sorting
    + GLM
    + R Markdown
* Are any organization types correlated with frequency or amount of unclaimed money?
    + i.e. Financial Services.
    + i.e. Insurance.
    + i.e. Government.
    + i.e. Utility.
    + i.e. Mortgage Lending etc.
* Is frequency different across different areas?
    + i.e. postcode, greater area, population density

# Approach 

* Anjali is modelling for the number of accounts
    + Counting accounts means weighting areas by their population to obtain meaningful model
    + Zero-truncated Poisson model to account for the fact that our data only takes into account the ones with missing money.
    
* Chen is modelling for the amounts in the accounts
    + Amounts requires working out the distribution it has with each variable and using the appropriate link function to create a meaningful model.
    + Finding the right distribution is going to be a challenge due to the amount of distributions covered by GLM and their similarity.
    
# Categorising Organisations

* First categorising top 100 company from the original data
    + the reasons for choosing top 100 company
```{r, echo=FALSE}
NumEntries = c(268, 276, 283, 289, 295, 299, 304, 307, 311, 314)
NumTopOrg = c(70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160)
percentage = NumEntries/380
ORGSUM = data.frame(NumEntries, NumTopOrg, percentage)
ORGSUM
```
* Then match the company category back into the original data

# Categorising Organisations

# Extracting Postcodes using regex function
* Data collation
    + File conversion
    + Merging
    + Extracting postcodes

* Sourced: Aus Post postcodes
* Removed: PO Box and Locked Bag numbers

Pattern for extracting postcodes (line-break for printing only)

$$ (0[289][0-9]{2})|([1345689][0-9]{3})|$$
$$ (2[0-8][0-9]{2})|(290[0-9])|(291[0-4])| $$
$$ (7[0-4][0-9]{2})|(7[8-9][0-9]{2}) $$


# Classifying Postcodes into categories

* Larger areas
    + Aggregate
    + Time
    + Relation to business categories

We classified postcodes by creating a function of if-statements:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
PC2Area = function(PC) {
  
  if( PC %in% c(2600, 2601, 2610) )
    return("Canberra CBD")
  if( PC >= 2601 && PC <= 2609 )
    return("Canberra Metro")
  ...

```

# Classifying Postcodes into categories

Area|Postcode Range
-----|-----------------------------------------
Sydney CBD|1100 - 1299, 2000, 2001, 2007, 2009
Sydney Metro|2002 - 2006, 2008, 2010 - 2234
Riverina Area|2640 - 2660
Wollongong|2500 - 2534
Newcastle|2265 - 2333
Northern Rivers|2413 - 2484
Rest of NSW|2235 - 2412, 2485 - 2999
...|...

# Adding population data for each area

* ABS
* 2014
* 38 areas

We matched all 38 postcode areas to the corresponding ABS data:

PC AREA|ABS AREA|2014 POP.

Sydney CBD|Sydney Inner City|203774 
Sydney Metro|Greater Sydney|4636854

# Concept
* GLM = "generalised linear model"
* Mildly non-normally distributed responses
    + i.e Number of accounts 
    + i.e Amount of money lost

* Use different distribution of errors (may not be normally distributed). 
* Handles responses 
    + 0 or 1 (binomial regression) 
    + Discrete counts (Poisson regression)
* GLM transforms the data to make the response and variables linearly for distributions from the exponential family.


# Statistical Theory

GLM = linear model + link function 
      + distribution mean + dispersion parameter (not always needed)

This is the exponential family model:
$$ f(y | \theta,\phi)=exp(\frac{y\theta-b(\theta)}{a(\phi)}+c(y,\phi)) $$

Canonical link functions for GLMs: $\mu=g^{-1}(X\beta)$

Family|C. Link|Variance Function
:-------:|:------:|:-------------------------------------:
$Normal$|$\mu$|$1$
$Poisson$|$\log(\mu)$|$\mu$
$Binomial$|$\log(\frac{\mu}{1-\mu})$|$\frac{\mu}{1-\mu}$
$Gamma$|$\frac{1}{\mu}$|$\mu^2$
$Inverse Gaussian$|$\frac{1}{\mu^2}$|$\mu^3$

# Poisson Distribution
For a Poisson distribution, the link function is derived as follows: 

Poisson formula: $f(y | \theta,\phi)=\frac{e^{-\mu}\mu^y}{y!}$

After some manipulation: $exp(y\log(\mu)-\mu-\log(y!))$

Therefore, the canonical link function is: 

$$ \theta=\log(\mu) $$ 

...as this is the part multiplied by $y$, but containing no $y$.

In statistics, $\log$ is base $e$ and $\mu$ is the mean. 

In this way, GLM can be used to capture non-linear data structures.
