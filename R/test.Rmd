# Introduction

"People forget about accounts. They are bad bookkeepers, they move to different places and don't receive notices, they become insane or demented and they die. All of these unfortunate facts of life mean that there are substantial sums of "unclaimed money" in the hands of companies. 

Our legal system, in common with most others, has taken the view that unclaimed money should benefit the public purse rather than be a private windfall."

This research takes an in-depth look at both the monetary value and the number of accounts containing unclaimed money across Australia. 

Reasons for choosing this topic:
* No one has analysed this data publicly due to the lack of profit.
* It is a challenge. We do our analysis from scratch using messy, real-world data and learn lots of useful coding skills and practical problem-solving skills.
* It is public data set, so we do not have to worry about copyright.

# Approach
Data is available for unclaimed money for 380,671 accounts, going back to the year 1900. Methodology  involves data visualisation using Tableau, a drag and drop tool used for visual exploration, as well as R for merging, cleaning, sorting and GLM analysis, reproducing useful visualisations in code, and producing the final report using R Markdown. 

* What variables affect the amount of unclaimed money, as well as the number of accounts?
* Are any organization types correlated with frequency or amount of unclaimed money?
    + i.e. Financial Services.
    + i.e. Insurance.
    + i.e. Government.
    + i.e. Utility.
    + i.e. Mortgage Lending etc.
* Is frequency different across different areas?
    + i.e. postcode, greater area, population density
* Regression over the years of the dates each account was classified as unclaimed.

# Approach 

* The individual parts of the project are the modelling for the amounts vs. the modelling for the number of accounts
    + Counting accounts means weighting areas by their population to obtain meaningful frequencies
    + ...as well as using a zero-truncated Poisson model to account for the fact that our data only takes into account the ones with missing money.
    + Amounts requires working out the distribution it has with each variable and using the appropriate link function to create a meaningful model.
    + Finding the right distribution is going to be a challenge due to the amount of distributions covered by GLM and their similarity.
    
$$ P(X=x)=\frac{\lambda ^ k e^{- \lambda} }{k ! \left ( 1 - e^{- \lambda} \right )} $$

# Resources out there...

Some analysis takes place through businesses, such as AURFS, which locate claimants and offer claiming services in exchange for a percentage of the claim. However, this ignores the vast amount of money held in small amounts across many accounts. 

ASIC is tasked with locating and informing claimants of money but have expressed lack of resources and overwhelming number of accounts due to law changes.

So, we downloaded public data from NSW Office of State Revenue (OSR), 2014 population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), then...

# Extracting Postcodes using regex function
Data collation has so far involved file conversion, merging the 26 alphabetical files into one, and extracting postcodes using a regex function The regex pattern was sourced using Australia Post postcode area definitions. PO Box and Locked Bag numbers were being included in the regex, therefore all 4 digits numbers after the words PO Box or Locked Bag had to be removed before extracting the data.

Pattern for extracting postcodes (line-break for printing only)

$$ AU <- "(0[289][0-9]{2})|([1345689][0-9]{3})|$$
$$ (2[0-8][0-9]{2})|(290[0-9])|(291[0-4])| $$
$$ (7[0-4][0-9]{2})|(7[8-9][0-9]{2})" $$


# Classifying Postcodes into categories
Postcodes needed to be categorised into larger areas to allow sufficient variation of data in each of the categories to facilitate analysis of the data overall. The postcode ranges were sourced online:

We classified postcodes by creating a function of if-statements:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
PC2Area = function(PC) {
  
  if( PC %in% c(2600, 2601, 2610) )                                                                                  return("Canberra CBD")
  if( PC >= 2601 && PC <= 2609 )                                                                                     return("Canberra Metro")
  ...

```

# Categorising Organisations
Categories for the top 100 companies were collated by hand using company websites and information available on ASX (Australian Share Index). The sum of the number of accounts increased by only 1% for every 10 companies added above 100, whereas leading up to 100, the number of accounts was increasing by 2% with diminishing return after 100. The top 100 occurring organisations covers 75% of the data. The number 100 was decided upon in the following method:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Making a matrix for optimising organisation classification
NumEntries = c(268, 276, 283, 289, 295, 299, 304, 307, 311, 314)
NumTopOrg = c(70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160)
percentage = NumEntries/380
ORGSUM = data.frame(NumEntries, NumTopOrg, percentage)
```

To match the column 'Organisation.Name' in Unclaimed Money (UM) with the column 'Organisation.Type' in Company Category (CC), which was categorised by hand...

# Adding population data for each area
We downloaded a file from ABS website (File name 3218.0 Regional Population Growth, Australia) which was released at 11:30 am 31/03/2015.  We used the latest data from 2014, and categorised the postcode into 21 areas.
We matched all 21 postcode areas to the corresponding ABS data:

# Concept
GLM is named the "generalised linear model" due to its capability of unifying statistical models. It can handle non-normal responses such as the number of accounts and amount of money lost.

The main difference is that GLM allows the user to specify the distribution of errors, whereas linear models assume the distribution of errors is normal. 

GLM handles responses that consist of either 0 or 1 through binomial regression, and discrete counts through Poisson regression. GLM transforms the data to make the response and variables linearly related regardless of whether that data within them follows a normal distribution. 


# Statistical Theory

GLM = linear model + link function ( depend on distribution model) + dispersion parameter

This is the generalised model:
$$ f(y | \theta,\phi)=exp(\frac{y\theta-b(\theta)}{a(\phi)}+c(y,\phi)) $$

Canonical link functions for GLMs:

Family|Link|Variance Function
:-------:|:------:|:-------------------------------------:
$Normal$|$\mu$|$1$
$Poisson$|$\log(\mu)$|$\mu$
$Binomial$|$\log(\frac{\mu}{1-\mu})$|$\frac{\mu}{1-\mu}$
$Gamma$|$\frac{1}{\mu}$|$\mu^2$

# Poisson Distribution
For a Poisson distribution, the link function is derived as follows: 

$$ f(y | \theta,\phi)=\frac{e^{-\mu}\mu^y}{y!} $$
$$ exp(\log(\mu^y)-\mu+-\log(y!)) $$

Therefore, the link function is 
$$\theta=\log(\mu) $$

In statistics, $\log$ is base 10 and $\mu$ is the mean. 
In this way, GLM can be used to capture non-linear data structures.
